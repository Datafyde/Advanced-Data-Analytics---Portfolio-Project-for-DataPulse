Data cleaning and analysis


1.	Handling Missing Values
Some of the columns, such as NUMBER_OF_OFFENCES, may contain missing values. You can handle them by replacing NULL values with default values (e.g., 0) or using other strategies.

UPDATE final_project.public.final_project
SET NUMBER_OF_OFFENCES = 0
WHERE NUMBER_OF_OFFENCES IS NULL;

SELECT
  *
FROM
  FINAL_PROJECT.PUBLIC.FINAL_PROJECT

2.	Removing Duplicates

SELECT *
FROM FINAL_PROJECT.PUBLIC.FINAL_PROJECT
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY YEAR, FORCE_NAME, OFFENCE_CODE ORDER BY YEAR ASC NULLS LAST) = 1;


3.	Validating Data Types
Ensure that all columns have appropriate data types. 
SELECT * FROM FINAL_PROJECT.PUBLIC.FINAL_PROJECT 
WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER(NUMBER_OF_OFFENCES) IS NULL AND NUMBER_OF_OFFENCES IS NOT NULL;

4.	Data Formatting
-- Trim whitespace and ensure consistent case (e.g., upper case for force names)
UPDATE FINAL_PROJECT.PUBLIC.FINAL_PROJECT
SET FORCE_NAME = UPPER(TRIM(FORCE_NAME)),
    OFFENCE_DESCRIPTION = TRIM(OFFENCE_DESCRIPTION),
    OFFENCE_GROUP = TRIM(OFFENCE_GROUP),
    OFFENCE_SUBGROUP = TRIM(OFFENCE_SUBGROUP);
