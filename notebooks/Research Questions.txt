Research Questions: Clearly draft research questions based on the provided dataset.

The dataset contains the following key columns:
1.	YEAR: The financial year in which the data was recorded (e.g., 2012/13).
2.	FINANCIAL_QUARTER: The quarter of the financial year.
3.	FORCE_NAME: The police force or department responsible for recording the data.
4.	OFFENCE_DESCRIPTION: A description of the specific offence.
5.	OFFENCE_GROUP: The broader category of crime (e.g., "Violence against the person").
6.	OFFENCE_SUBGROUP: A more specific subcategory of the offence group.
7.	OFFENCE_CODE: The code assigned to the offence.
8.	NUMBER_OF_OFFENCES: The number of offences recorded.

Based on this, here are the research questions:
1.	What seasonal or quarterly variations can be identified in crime rates, 
        and which offences exhibit the most fluctuation?

2.      What are the long-term trends in fraud-related offences across different financial years?

3.      What is the relationship between the rise in theft-related crimes and other factors
        such as unemployment or economic downturns?

4.       How do drug offences compare in high-crime areas versus other regions, and what 
         interventions are most effective in curbing these trends?

5.       How do crime rates vary between high-crime areas compared to lower-crime regions?
