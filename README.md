# Advanced Data Analytics - Portfolio Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains the dataset and project files for the Advanced Data Analytics portfolio project as part of the Advanced Data Analytics training at Datafied Academy. This project focuses on analyzing large datasets using big data technologies such as SQL and Python. The analysis is complemented with visualizations produced using Python and Power BI or Google Looker Studio.

## Learning Outcomes
- LO1: Critically exemplify the skills required for effectively representing, structuring, analyzing, manipulating, and accessing large datasets.
- LO2: Identify and critique significant current issues in the implementation and use of a range of Big Data Analytics Strategies.
- LO3: Integrate various computing technologies to provide an effective solution for a set of data-driven business requirements.

### Sections A. Data Analysis (75%)
- **Research Questions:** Clearly draft research questions based on the provided dataset.
- **Dataset Creation:** Merge or create a new dataset using SQL queries or Python.
